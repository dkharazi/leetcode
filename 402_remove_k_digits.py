# 402. Remove K Digits

# Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
#
# Note:
#
#     The length of num is less than 10002 and will be ≥ k.
#     The given num does not contain any leading zero.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
# Output: "1219"
# Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: num = "10200", k = 1
# Output: "200"
# Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: num = "10", k = 2
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

    # Go through the digits from left to right, remove previous digits if that makes the number smaller
    # (and if we still have to remove digits).
