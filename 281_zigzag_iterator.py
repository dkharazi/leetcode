# 281: Zigzag Iterator

# Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

# For example, given two 1d vectors:
	
# v1 = [1, 2]
# v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

# By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
# the order of elements returned by next should be: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6].

# Follow up: What if you are given k 1d vectors? 
# How well can your code be extended to such cases?

# Clarification for the follow up question – Update (2015-09-18):
# The “Zigzag” order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases. 
# If “Zigzag” does not look right to you, replace “Zigzag” with “Cyclic”. 
# For example, given the following input:
	
# [1,2,3]
# [4,5,6,7]
# [8,9]

# It should return [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
